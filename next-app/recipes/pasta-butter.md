**In several Italian dialects cacio e pepe translates as ‘cheese and
pepper, and that’s essentially all that goes into this sauce. The
magic ingredient that binds them together is the pasta cooking
water. It is full of starch, which emulsifies with the butter and helps
the sauce cling to the pasta. The Parmesan crisps are optional, but
such an easy and impressive way to finish the dish.**

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/Gas 6. Line a baking tray
with baking paper.

2. To make the crisps, take half the Parmesan and place it in four
equal piles on the prepared tray. Place on a high shelf in the
oven for 10–12 minutes, or until the Parmesan has turned golden
brown. Set aside.

3. Bring a kettle of water to the boil. Half-fill a saucepan with it,
season with salt and return to the boil. (It’s important to add just
enough water to cover the pasta so that the water will become
as starchy as possible.) Add the pasta, stir well and cook for 10
minutes, or until al dente.

4. Meanwhile, toast the peppercorns in a dry frying pan until
aromatic. Using a pestle and mortar, grind them coarsely.

5. Place a large sauté pan over a medium heat and melt the butter
in it. Add the ground pepper and let the butter foam, then add a
ladleful of the pasta water and bring to the boil. Swirl the pan or
whisk the contents to emulsify the sauce.

6. Remove the pasta from the water with tongs and add it to the
sauté pan with a second ladleful of the water and the remaining
Parmesan. Stir well to coat, and add more pasta water if
needed.

7. Add the pecorino and salt, tossing the pan to combine.

8. Serve in bowls with the Parmesan crisps crumbled over the top.
