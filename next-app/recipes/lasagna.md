**Description**

1. First we brown our beef. Use vegetable oil, because it has a higher temperature to burn. When the meat is cooked, season with salt, pepper and sprinkle of dried chillies. Add both tins of tomatoes, 
chicken stock, teaspoon of chilli paste and finely chopped rosemary.

2. Chop the onions and celery sticks and peel and grate the carrots. Throw the vegetables into a pan with olive oil and cook on medium-high heat until caramelized. Add the garlic and let cook for another minute. 
Lightly season, add the tomato paste, teaspoon of chilli paste and stir well.

3. Combine the meat and the vegetables into one pot and let simmer on low heat for around an hour and a half.

4. When the meat sauce becomes whole, add quarter of milk and reduce to the original volume. Then add another quarter of milk and reduce again.

5. Meanwhile, quarter the leak and roughly chop. Put the butter in a pan and when it's starting to sizzle, add the leak. Add the plain flour and saute for about a minute. Add half of your milk, stir well and blend
in the pan until smooth. Grate the nutmeg into the mixture and season with black pepper generously. Add half of mozarella, half of parmigiano and stir on high heat until the sauce is thick.

6. When the sauce is ready, take it off heat and add your egg yolks while stirring constantly, so the eggs wont cook whole.

7. Layer the meat, the white sauce and the pasta into the baking dish. First layer should be from meat, so the pasta will not stick to the baking dish. Sprinkle with chopped parsley after each white sauce layer.
At last, sprinkle the top layer with remaining parmigiano, mozarella and parsley.

8. Cook in the oven for about 45 minutes on 180 degrees Celsius.

9. After the lasagna is cooked, let it sit and cool down for at least 10 to 15 minutes.
