**All types of fish are quick to cook, but tuna wins the speed prize
because it’s served rare in the middle and is literally in and out of
the pan in four minutes. These steaks are seasoned with sumac,
which has a lemony tang. It offsets the meaty tuna brilliantly and
complements the Moroccan flavours in the couscous.**

1. Put the couscous into a heatproof bowl. Using a pestle and
mortar, grind the saffron to a powder, then place in a small
saucepan with the preserved lemon and vegetable stock. Bring to the boil and pour over the couscous. Stir well, cover the bowl
with cling film and leave to sit for 5–10 minutes.


2. Meanwhile, finely dice the cucumber and roughly chop the
herbs.

3. Uncover the couscous and fluff it up with a fork. Add the
cucumber, herbs, chickpeas, extra virgin olive oil and a little
lemon juice. Mix well and season with salt and pepper. Set
aside.


4. Place a large, non-stick frying pan over a medium–high heat.
Drizzle the tuna steaks with the olive oil and season both sides
with salt and pepper. When the pan is smoking hot, add the tuna
and cook for 2 minutes on each side.


5. Spoon the couscous onto plates and place the tuna on top.
Sprinkle each plate with the sumac and serve with lemon
wedges and a green salad.

**If you have more time…**
… make the Moroccan Carrot Salad on page 205 to go with this.
It will turn a simple lunch into a feast.
