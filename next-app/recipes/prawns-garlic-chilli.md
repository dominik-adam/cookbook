**Prawns – in fact, shellfish in general – are the perfect fast food
because they take just a few minutes to cook. All the work here is
in chopping the garlic and chilli and quartering the tomatoes. Make
sure you serve these lip-smackingly good prawns with plenty of
good bread for mopping up all the juices, and a lot of paper
napkins as things could get messy…**

1. Place a large, non-stick frying pan over a medium–high heat and
add the oil. When hot, add the garlic, chilli and chilli flakes (if
using), and stir gently for 1 minute.

2. Add the prawns and cook until pink on one side. Turn each of
the prawns over and add the sherry, tomato purée and cherry
tomatoes. Cook for 1–2 minutes, or until the prawns are pink all
over, then transfer the prawns to a plate. Continue to cook the
mixture in the pan for 2–3 more minutes, until the tomatoes
have softened.

3. Return the prawns to the pan, stir in the butter and parsley, and
season to taste. Serve with a green salad and some crusty
bread to mop up the delicious sauce.
