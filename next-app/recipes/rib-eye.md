**Many people order steaks when they go out to a restaurant, but
they never cook them at home, which is just daft, if you ask me.
Cooking a steak is incredibly easy – no prep, a few minutes
basting with butter in a hot pan, and a few minutes to rest
afterwards, job done. And the sauce takes only a few minutes
more to rustle up. The main thing is to buy a decent steak, as no
amount of basting or smothering with sauce can make a rubbish
steak taste anything but rubbish.**

1. Place a large, non-stick frying pan over a high heat. Rub the
olive oil over the steaks and season liberally with salt and
pepper. When the pan is smoking hot, add the steaks and cook
for 2–3 minutes on each side if you like your steaks medium
rare.

2. Remove the pan from the heat, then add the thyme and butter,
and baste, baste, baste the steaks for at least a minute. Turn
them over and baste again. Transfer the steaks and thyme to a
warm plate and leave to rest.

3. Return the pan to a medium heat, add the shallot and cook for
2–3 minutes, or until softened. Add the green peppercorns and
garlic and cook for 1–2 minutes.

4. Pour in the cognac and flambe carefully. Add the mustard, beef
stock and Worcestershire sauce, stir well and increase the heat
to high. Let the stock reduce by half before adding the cream.
Allow it to cook for another few minutes, or until the cream has
thickened.

5. Put the rested steaks on serving plates, making sure to pour any
resting juices into the sauce. Stir the sauce well and season to
taste before pouring it over the steaks and serving with green
vegetables.

**Chef’s tip**
Always dry meat and fish thoroughly with kitchen paper before
frying, as any moisture will slow down caramelisation, and you
risk overcooking the steak, chop or fillet while trying to get a nice
colour.

**If you have more time…**
… serve with the Mustard Mash on page 213 or the Green Beans
with Tarragon and Pine Nuts on page 206.
