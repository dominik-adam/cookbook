**I know hollandaise sauce has a reputation for being tricky to make,
but if you take your time when you add the butter and don’t let it
get too hot, you can produce an amazing, restaurant-quality sauce
in your own kitchen. The tart grapefruit cuts through the buttery
richness of the sauce and gives it a very slight pink blush that
looks stunning with the salmon and pink peppercorns.**

1. Start by making the hollandaise sauce: put the wine, vinegar,
shallot and tarragon into a small saucepan and heat until
reduced to about 2 tablespoons of liquid. Strain, discarding the
solids, and set aside until needed.

2. Melt the 200g butter over a gentle heat and carefully pour the
golden liquid into a jug, discarding the milky solids at the bottom
of the pan.

3. Place a heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Add the
egg yolks, grapefruit juice and zest plus half of the reduced
vinegar. Whisk until frothy and thick, then slowly add the melted
butter, whisking constantly. Stir through the chives, then season
with salt and pepper and add a little warm water if it’s too thick.
Add the remaining vinegar reduction if you prefer a bit more
tang. Put to one side.

4. Score the skin on the salmon fillets, then brush with the olive oil
and season on both sides with salt and pepper. Place a large,
non-stick frying pan over a medium–high heat and, when hot,
add the salmon, skin side down. Reduce the heat to medium–
low and cook for about 5 minutes, until the skin is quite crisp. Flip over and cook the other side for 2–3 minutes, until slightly
springy to the touch. Remove and allow the fish to rest for a few
minutes.

5. Meanwhile, put the asparagus into a large sauté pan with the
water, butter and a little salt and pepper. Place over a high heat
and cook for 5 minutes, or until tender.

6. Put a salmon fillet on each serving plate and place some
asparagus alongside. Spoon the hollandaise over the salmon
and sprinkle with a few pink peppercorns. If you wish, serve with
a wedge of pink grapefruit on the side.
