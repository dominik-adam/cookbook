**Lemon and chicken is a classic pairing, but by adding both fresh
and preserved lemons to this recipe, the lemon flavour is
intensified and it becomes something new. The almost molten
sauce is sweet, sticky and utterly delicious. Serve with mashed
potatoes (see page 213), lightly cooked green vegetables or a
simple salad to counterbalance the richness.**

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/Gas 6.

2. Place a large ovenproof frying pan over a high heat and, when
hot, add the olive oil. Season the chicken thighs with salt and
pepper and add them to the pan with the garlic and thyme
sprigs. Cook for 2–3 minutes on each side, or until golden
brown.

3. Meanwhile, slice the fresh lemon very finely on a mandolin, and
roughly chop the preserved lemon.

4. Add the sherry vinegar to the frying pan and allow to reduce by
half before adding the soy sauce and honey. Shake the pan to mix 
the sauce and reduce the heat to medium–high.

5. Pour in the tablespoon of water, then add the fresh and
preserved lemons and bring to a simmer and place in the oven
for 10–15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and
the sauce has reduced to a thick syrup.

6. Transfer the chicken to a serving dish and sprinkle with the
parsley before serving with green vegetables or a salad.

**Chef’s tip**
To get more juice out of a lemon, heat it in the microwave for 20
seconds on full power before squeezing it. The heat helps break
down the membranes in the fruit, which means the juice is
released more easily.
