**Make sure you buy thick-cut chops for this recipe and take them
out of the fridge at least five minutes before cooking, ideally
longer, as bringing them nearer to room temperature will prevent
the meat from drying out, which can be a real danger with pork.
Dressing the potatoes while they are still warm means that they
really absorb the flavours of the bacon, onions and vinaigrette, and
will consequently taste much better.**

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan/Gas 6.

2. Bring a kettle of water to the boil, then pour it into a saucepan.
Season with salt and bring back to the boil over a medium–high
heat. Add the potatoes and cook for 15 minutes, or until tender.

3. Place a large, ovenproof frying pan over a high heat. Drizzle the
vegetable oil over the pork chops and season with salt and
pepper. When the pan is hot, add the chops and cook for 1–2
minutes on each side. Add the butter and, when foaming, baste
the meat with it. Add the garlic and thyme, then transfer the pan
to the oven for 6–8 minutes. When the chops are cooked
through, transfer to a warm plate and allow to rest.

4. Meanwhile, place a frying pan over a medium–high heat and add
the bacon lardons. Cook for 5–8 minutes, or until crisp and
golden. Drain on kitchen paper.

5. Combine the dressing ingredients in a bowl and whisk together.

6. When the potatoes are cooked, drain in a colander, then
transfer to a bowl and crush lightly with a fork. Stir in the spring
onions and crispy bacon. Drizzle over two-thirds of the dressing,
then stir well and season with salt and pepper.

7. Combine the salad ingredients in a bowl, add the remaining
dressing and toss well.

8. Drizzle the pork chops with some of the pan juices and serve
with a generous spoonful of the crushed potatoes and the salad
on the side.

**Time-saving tip**
Make double or triple the recipe for this simple salad dressing
and keep it in a jar or bottle to save time when you next need to
dress a salad.
