**Despite being a really quick recipe, this is a deeply delicious pasta
sauce. Browning, or burning, the butter completely transforms the
flavour into something much richer and more interesting. Hold your
nerve during the browning, and don’t take the pan off the heat until
you smell the tell-tale aroma – it should be sweet and nutty with
rich caramel notes.**

1. Bring a kettle of water to the boil. Half-fill a saucepan with it,
season with salt and return to the boil. (It’s important to add just
enough water to cover the pasta so that the water will become
as starchy as possible.) Add the pasta, stir well and cook for 10
minutes, or until al dente.

2. Meanwhile, put the butter into a sauté pan and place it over a
high heat. When it begins to brown, remove from the heat, add
the sage leaves and garlic and stir well.

3. Drain the pasta, reserving the cooking water.

4. Pour a ladleful of the reserved water into the sauté pan and add
the peas. Return the pan to the heat and cook for 1–2 minutes,
stirring constantly.

5. Add the pasta and Parmesan and stir well. Add a little more
pasta water, if needed, and season to taste.

6. Serve in warm bowls with a twist of black pepper and extra
Parmesan sprinkled on top.


**Chef’s tip**
Get into the habit of always putting a bowl under the colander
when draining pasta so you never pour the starchy cooking water
down the plughole – you always need a little to help the sauce
really stick to the pasta.
