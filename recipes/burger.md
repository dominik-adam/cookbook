**For Americans, burger sauce is almost as important as the burgers
themselves. The pickles, sauce and relish market is huge, but you
can make this excellent version at home by simply mixing together
a handful of ingredients that you are likely to have already in your
kitchen. It is guaranteed to take your home-made burgers to the
next level.**

1. Preheat the grill to high.

2. Put the bacon on a baking tray and place under the grill for 8â€“10
minutes, or until crisp.

3. Mix together all the sauce ingredients.

4. Place the minced beef in a bowl and season with salt and
pepper. Mix well with clean hands and form into 4 large burgers.

5. Heat the oil in a large frying pan and, when hot, add the burgers.
Cook for 3 minutes on each side, then top each one with a slice
of cheese, turn the heat down low and put a lid on the pan.

6. When the bacon is cooked, cut the burger buns in half and place
under the grill until lightly toasted.

7. Spread 2 spoonfuls of the sauce on the bottom half of the buns,
then put the burgers on top followed by the bacon. Now add the
tomato slices, gherkins and lettuce. Spread another 2 spoonfuls
of the sauce on the remaining halves of the buns and place
them on top.
