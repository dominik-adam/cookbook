**Schnitzel is a real crowd pleaser in our house – I think it’s the
crunch of the breadcrumbs with the salty savouriness of the pork
that appeals to kids and adults alike. It’s quick too, as the chops
are flattened before you cook them, reducing the time they spend
in the pan. The remoulade is only super-fast if you have a food
processor to shred the celeriac – doing it by hand will take much
longer.**

1. Using a sharp knife, trim the fat off each pork chop. Lay them
between two pieces of cling film and use a mallet or rolling pin to
flatten them out to a thickness of 5mm.

2. Put the flour into a shallow bowl, season with salt and pepper
and mix well. Lightly beat the egg in a second shallow bowl. Put
the breadcrumbs into a third shallow bowl and mix in the dill and
paprika. Season both sides of the chops, then coat each one

first in the flour, then in the egg and finally in the breadcrumbs.
3. For the remoulade, put the celeriac, mayonnaise, mustard, sour
cream and parsley into a large bowl and mix well. Add a little
lemon juice and season to taste. Set aside.

4. Heat a 1cm depth of vegetable oil in a frying pan. When hot,
carefully add the schnitzels and cook for 2–3 minutes on each
side. Drain on kitchen paper.

5. Serve the schnitzels with a generous spoonful of the remoulade,
a handful of watercress and a lemon wedge (if using) on the
side.
