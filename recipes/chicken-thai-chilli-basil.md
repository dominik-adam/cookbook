**Thai basil is woodier and more robust than regular Italian basil, and
has a spicy aniseed flavour that is quite distinct from its European
cousin’s. It isn’t always easy to get hold of, but it’s worth trying to
track down to experience for yourself. When stir-frying, efficiency
is everything – get all your ingredients prepped before you start
and the process of getting dinner on the table will be seamless.**

1. Wash the rice three times until the water runs clear, then place
in a saucepan with the measured water and a pinch of salt.
Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat to a low simmer and
place a lid on the pan. Cook for a further 10–12 minutes, or until
the liquid has gone and the rice is cooked.

2. Meanwhile, prepare the meat and all the vegetables for the stirfry. Season the chicken with salt and white pepper.

3. Place a wok over a very high heat until smoking hot. Add 1
tablespoon vegetable oil and stir-fry a quarter of the chicken for
1 minute, or until it has browned lightly. Quickly remove the wok
from the heat and transfer the chicken to a plate. Return the
wok to the heat and cook the remaining chicken in the same
way, adding more oil as necessary.

4. Combine the oyster sauce, soy sauce, chicken stock, fish sauce
and sugar in a small bowl. In a separate bowl, mix the cornflour
with the water.

5. Put the wok back on the heat, adding more oil as necessary,
then stir-fry the garlic and half the chillies for 1 minute.

6. Add the onion and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Add the broccoli and
green beans and cook for 2 minutes, adding a little water if they
begin to stick.

7. Return the chicken to the wok and cook for a further 2–3
minutes.

8. Add the oyster and soy sauce mixture to the wok, then stir in
the cornflour paste and Thai basil leaves and cook for 1 more
minute.

9. Spoon the rice and stir-fry into bowls and sprinkle with the
remaining chillies and basil leaves before serving.
