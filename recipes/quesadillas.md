**My kids love these chilli quesadillas – they’re always gone minutes
after they hit the table. But my lot, especially Jack, like things
particularly hot and spicy, so go easy on the jalapeños if you’re
feeding a more sensitive crowd, or leave them out altogether.
Making the salsa from scratch might seem like an added hassle
but it’s definitely worth it.**

1. Preheat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan/Gas 7. Line two large
baking trays with baking paper.

2. Place a large, non-stick frying pan over a high heat. Add the oil
and onion and cook for 2–3 minutes, or until the onion has
softened. Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes, then crumble in
the minced beef. Cook over a high heat for 4–5 minutes, or until
the mince is lightly browned.

3. Stir in the spices and cook for 1–2 minutes. Add the tinned
tomatoes, cook for 2 minutes, then remove from the heat. Stir in
the kidney beans and season to taste.

4. Lightly brush one side of a tortilla with extra oil and place on a
prepared tray, oiled side down. Sprinkle a little cheese over one
half and spread a quarter of the beef mixture on top. Scatter
some spring onions, jalapeños and cheese on top before folding
over the tortilla. Repeat for the remaining tortillas.

5. Brush one side of the 2 remaining tortillas with oil and place on
top of the beef filling, oiled side up. Press them down firmly and
place on the two highest shelves of the oven for 10–15 minutes,
or until golden brown.

6. While the quesadillas are cooking, mix all the salsa ingredients
in a bowl and season to taste.

7. Remove the quesadillas from the oven and cut into wedges
before serving with a dollop of sour cream and some salsa on
the side
